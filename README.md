## AI-Powered Suggestions (Gemini API Integration)

**Google's Gemini API** helps enhance user experience with smart suggestions powered by generative AI. Suggestions are based real-time weather conditions:

### Food Suggestions
- Suggests meals or drinks ideal for the current weather.

### Activity Suggestions
- Recommends weather-appropriate activities.
- Includes visual descriptions.
- Dynamically adapts based on your local weather info.

These features use:
- `gemini-2.0-flash` for food suggestions.
- `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` for activity suggestions.
